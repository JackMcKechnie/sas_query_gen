        - English is your first language <br>

        <b>Invitation</b> <br>

        You are invited to participate in a research study. Your participation is completely voluntary. Before
        beginning, please take some time to read this document to learn why this study is being carried out

        <b>What is the Enron email collection?</b><br>

        This study makes use of the Enron email collection. Enron was an American energy company
        founded in 1985. The company went bankrupt in 2001 and was involved in a number of different
        scandals at the time. As part of investigations into the company, the Federal Energy Regulatory
        Commision publicly released the emails of employees - the Enron email collection.<br>

        <b>Purpose of the study</b><br>

        The purpose of this project is to gather data to create a test collection to be used in the development
        of search systems that can protect information that is sensitive, whilst still providing relevant
        information. To do this we need to collect queries that users would enter into a search engine to find
        information on a topic and to collect judgements of how relevant a document is to a topic.<br>

        <b>What will I have to do if I take part?</b><br>

        You will be presented with a consent form before the experiment starts. After you have provided your
        consent, you will complete a short (approximately 10 minute) online task. This is one of two things:<br>

        1) You will be presented with a short paragraph that describes a topic that you would like to find

        information about. You are asked to then provide a query that you would enter into a search
        engine in order to find out information about this topic.<br>

        2) You will be presented with a query and a document. You are asked to read through the

        document thoroughly and then judge how relevant that document is to the query that was
        provided.<br>

        You will be paid at the rate of approximately Â£9/hour.<br>

        <b>Are there any risks?</b><br>

        There are no significant known risks to you in participating in this project. Reading the documents may
        cause some slight fatigue. In this case please take a break, step away from the computer for a while,
        and come back to the task when you feel ready.<br>
